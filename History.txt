   Now several render contexts can be created. Shared render contexts for multi-threading or secondary render contexts
   to have several graphics windows.
   
 * CMake config file added
   Finally the "SoftPixel Engine" project got a CMake configuration file. Now project files for
   the most popular IDEs can be created automatically: VisualStudio, Xcode, Code::Blocks etc.
   Pre-compiled DLLs will further more be available.
   
 * Added deferred-renderer
   The integrated deferred-renderer uses Cg shaders to be used for all render systems.


VERSION 3.1 (version of mobile platform support: Android, iOS, OpenGL|ES, OpenSL|ES) [ 09/01/2012 ]
   
 * Completion of a new NetworkSystem (v.3.0)
   Finally there is a complete working network system. The first time that in this system clients can send packets to clients.
   Currently only TCP/IP is supported.
   
 * Android support
   Now the Engine runs on the Android mobile platform, too. To develop for Android the "Android NDK" is required.
   You also have to use "eclipse" and the "Android SDK" but you don't need to write any line of code in Java.
   
 * New renderer: OpenGL|ES 1.1
   This new renderer has been added for mobile platforms.
   
 * Updated File system
   Completed "FileRAM" class and added "FileAsset" class for reading Android resource files.
   
 * Updated jpeglib
   
 * New sound system: OpenSL|ES 1.0.1
   This new sound system has been added for the mobile platform Android.
   
 * Linux update
   Finally 2D text drawing and anti-aliasing is supported for Linux. Also the "InputControl::getCursorSpeed" function has been updated.
   
 * iOS support
   Now the Engine runs on the iOS mobile platform, too. To develop for iOS at least "Xcode 3" and
   "Mac OS X" (with "Intel" processor) are required. The Xcode project files are at 'sources/Platform/iOS'.
   
 * Redesigned internal RenderSystem architecture
   Particular OpenGL has been redesigned internally to have a good base for porting to OpenGL|ES.
   
 * New renderer: OpenGL|ES 2.0
   This new renderer has been added for mobile platforms.
   
 * Support for vertex weights in skeletal animations
   Finally the engine can handle skeletal animations where several bones can deform one vertex using the vertex weights factor.
   
 * Changed "Log", "CollisionLibrary", "Randomizer" and "MemoryManager" classes into namespace because of only static functions.
   No change in syntax for the user but more C++ features available. Now you can use "using namespace" for these names
   that you don't need to write always the same name infront of the functions.
   
 * MorphTargetAnimation update
   Now vertex normals are also animated for correct lighting
   
 * New camera classes
   There are three new camera classes: FirstPersonCamera, TrackingCamera and BlenderCamera.
   The base Camera class has been redesigned to be derivable.
   
 * Integrated NVIDIA Cg toolkit for renderer independent shader programming.
   
 * MD3 mesh loader added
   Now also MD3 (Quake III Arena models) can be loaded and animated using morph-target animation
   
 * Seperated render context into own class (in progress)
   Now you need to flip the back buffer with the new class "RenderContext". Use 'SoftPixelDevice::getRenderContext' to get the main object.
   
 * Integrating boost (1.47.0)
   Now the SoftPixel Engine gets boosted! The high-level C++ extension library "boost" has been integrated in some parts.
   The integration will continue step by step. First of all every callback has been replaced by a "boost::function"
   and some for loops has been replaced by a BOOST_FOREACH loop.
   From now you'll need to download the boost library to use the "SoftPixel Engine" further.
   You can get boost from here: http://www.boost.org/.
   Currently only boost templates are used. Thus you don't need to build the boost library.
   
 * ANSI C FILE replaced by C++ filestream
   Now std::fstream is used for reading and writing HDD files and no longer ANSI C FILE pointers.
   
 * MultiSample RenderTarget support
   Support for multi sampled render targets has been added for the OpenGL render system (FrameBufferObjects).
   
 * Added hardware instancing for OpenGL and Direct3D 11.
   
 * Added "SoftPixel Sandbox Scene" loader.
   Create 3D scenes with the "SoftPixel Sandbox" and load them easily with the "SoftPixel Engine".
   
 * Recreated OBJ mesh loader
   
 * Mac OS X support (still in progress)
   Beginning of the "Mac OS X" port. This is still in progress and will be available for the next release.
   The Xcode project files are at 'sources/Platform/MacOSX'.


VERSION 3.0 (version of the new architecture, GUI reincarnation and physics library) [ 05/06/2011 ]
   
 * GUI reincarnation
   A completely new GUI has been created: "BoxGUI - v.2.0 alpha" including the following features:
   - Window system
   - Lots of gadgets (Buttons, Lists etc.)
   - Expansive menu
   
 * Hardware texture format can be choosen
   Finally the hardware texture format can be choosen between UByte (8-bit) and Float (16- and 32 bit).
   Float buffers for textures can be very useful when working with shaders (e.g. for real-time shadow mapping).
   
 * Multi-render-targets support has been added
   Using "Texture::addMultiRenderTarget" several textures can be bounded to one render-target.
   
 * Several bugfixes:
   - TGA images were sometimes fliped false.
   - GLSL constants were indexed wrong and can be set now correclty. GLSL constant arrays as well.
   
 * Cube map generation completed
   Using "VideoDriver::updateCubeMap" you can create dynamic cube maps for simple cube mapping, environmental bump mapping etc.
   
 * XML parser created
   Now XML files can be parsed easily. This tool (sp::tool::XMLParser) can be used to read HTML files or others
   written in a mark up language.
   
 * Small updates on the NetworkSystem
   Now differentiates between local and online servers to also get online content from web servers.
   
 * OpenGL tessellation shader added (incomplete)
   The "GL_ARB_tessellation_shader" extension for hardware tessellation since OpenGL 4.0 has been added.
   The tessellation control shader is called hull shader and the tessellation evaluation shader is called domain shader (based on Direct3D 11.0);
   
 * Material setup optimization
   If several objects with equal material states are rendered one after the other material setups will be optimized.
   This only works for OpenGL and Direct3D9 because of its render states. Direct3D11 has an internal optimization for this case.
   
 * Scene graph architecture has been recreated completely
   The scene graph has been redesigned for more flexibility again. Take a look inside the API docu to see the changes.
   Now it's quite easy to define an own "Mesh" class. Just extend it and write your own "render" function.
   All about nodes has been extended. Now there are the following classes about nodes: Node, SceneNode, RenderNode, MaterialNode, TreeNode.
   
 * Mesh buffer architecture has been recreated completely
   The "MeshBuffer" class is now an essential class for rendering 3d geometry. It's further more called
   a "surface" in the Mesh class but manipulating it is now more controlled by this class itself.
   
 * Mesh buffer vertex- and index format is now choosable
   Finally the vertex format and also the index format is chooseable. By default the vertex format
   requires less memory which makes the render process faster, too. You can now also create your own
   vertex format to have support for vertex shader attributes.
   
 * PathFinder tool has been added
   Using the tool::PathGraph class path finding can be achieved easily with the "A* Algorithm".
   
 * Integrated "NewtonGameDynamics" PhysicsEngine
   The first time that this engine got an external library. The "NewtonGameDynamics" physics engine
   (zlib/libpng Copyright (c) Julio Jerez and Alain Suero) has been added for easy physics simulation with the "SoftPixel Engine".
   Use the "physics::PhysicsSystem" class for adding rigid bodys, ragdolls and vehicles.


VERSION 2.1 (version of shader revolution: Geometry-, Hull-, Domain-, Compute Shaders) [ 17/09/2010 ]
   
 * Shader structure has changed
   The shader has divided into several Shader objects and one ShaderTable for a mesh.
   Now you can use shaders with only a vertex or pixel- and vertex shader together.
   
 * Geometry Shader for OpenGL added
   Since several shader types can be created and configured with more control also geometry shaders
   for OpenGL has been added.
   
 * More compilation options
   Now you can configure your own "SoftPixel Engine" version when compiling with more control.
   You can disable a lot of features if you only need a few of them to speed up the performance
   and make the engine more memory friendly. Look at the "spStandard.hpp" file.
   
 * Dummy video driver added
   The Dummy video driver for debugging and other none graphical purposes has been created.
   
 * Direct3D11 video driver added
   The Direct3D11 video driver has been implemented with full shader support:
   Vertex-, Pixel-, Geometry-, Hull-, Domain- and Compute Shader.
   - This driver possess a default basic shader because there is no longer a fixed-function-pipeline.
   - Perpixel lighting and other new features are available using this video driver.
   - Is backwards compatible until Direct3D 9.0a when required feature levels are not supported.
   
 * More bugfixes in loading textures
   - BMP image loading bugfix for "None Power Of Two" (NPOT) images.
   - TGA image loading several bugfixes.
   - OpenGL texture creation with NPOT textures bugfixed
     (when an OpenGL NPOT texture is loaded the format is by default always RGBA).
   
 * Network system updated
   Some bugs has been fixed and new features has been addded.
   The network system was tested and integrated in a small video game which is now network ready.
   
 * Mesh vertices got tangent and binormal vectors
   More over the corresponding functions "set/getVertexTangent" and "set/getVertexBinormal"
   have been added to the "Mesh" class. The function "Mesh::updateTangentSpace" has been added, too.
   
 * SceneManager can be choosen
   Now the engine has several scene managers for different scene situations. By default the "SimpleSceneManager"
   is used. For extremely large scenes the "ExpansiveSceneManager" can be used - but this scene manager is
   currently only planed. You can also create your own scene managers.
   
 * ScriptLoader has been recreated
   The "ConstructiveScriptLoader" is now in version "3.0 beta" and has become a loader for a
   flexible, comfortable and easy script syntax. The "ConstructiveScript" is now also used
   for the "SoftPixelScene" format.
   
 * 3DS mesh loader recreated
   Finally the 3DS mesh loader creates the surfaces correctly and the loader is stable.
   Also the rotation is now correct so you will need to change the rotations for each 3DS mesh
   you loaded with a previous version.
   
 * X mesh loader recreated
   The X (DirectX) mesh loader has been recreated completely. Now it is much more stable and crash safe.
   
 * 3x3 matrix added
   
 * B3D mesh loader bugfixes
   
 * VisualStudio 2010 project files added
   
 * DirectDrawSurface (DDS) image loader added
   The new image loader supports uncompressed and compressed DDS files.
   Currently DXT1, DXT2 and DXT3 compressions are supported.
   
 * Surface reference function added
   Now also surfaces can be replaced by others to save video memory but to render instances with
   different texture lists. In addition creating new surfaces was also optimized.


VERSION 2.0 (version of revolutionary changes: mesh buffers, image buffers, classes) [ 29/06/2010 ]
   
 * Sprites got different wireframe modes.
   
 * New collision detection feature and bugfix
   Collision objects can be configured for only collision detection but no colliding.
   
 * Terrain class has been updated
   First functions for texturing Terrains have been added.
   Frustum culling for Terrain's quad-tree-nodes has been added.
   
 * File class updated
   The "File" class has been splitted into two classes:
   FileHDD (physical files) and FileRAM (virtual files - for interchange).
   
 * Bitmap (BMP) texture loader updated
   Bugs has been fixed, 1 bit and 4 bits image compatibility has been added.
   
 * Object copying has been completed
   Now copying objects (Meshes with animations etc.) works perfectly.
   
 * Individual primitive list drawing
   There is a new function for drawing primitive lists called "VideoDriver::drawPrimitiveList".
   It allows you to render to following kind of primitives:
   Points, Line list, Line strip, Line loop, Triangle list, Triangle strip, Triangle fan, Quad list, Quad strip, Polygon.
   Also supported for 2D drawing with "VideoDriver::draw2DPolygon" or "draw2DPolygonImage".
   
 * OpenGL 1.1 support
   Now the engine is able to reduce its features down to OpenGL 1.1 if the version is lower then 2.0 or 1.5.
   
 * Mesh buffer structure redesigned
   SMeshVertex3D structure has been redesigned and SMeshIndexedVertex3D has been removed.
   Finally Direct3D9 and OpenGL can use the same vertex arrays. i.e. Direct3D9 video driver became faster again.
   
 * 2x2 matrix added
   
 * Texture classes redesigned
   The texture and image buffer management have been redesigned and more structured.
   Now the textures needs only half the memory! There are a lots of new functions like "saveBackup",
   "setFilter", "setMipMapFilter" etc. Old things like "ClampEdges" has been removed but new functions
   like "setWrapMode" has been added to replace old features. To clamp the texture coordinates change the wrap mode
   to "setWrapMode(video::TEXWRAP_CLAMP)". Now you also can set the texture coordinates to mirror mode (TEXWRAP_MIRROR).
   
 * Depth texture support
   Finally depth textures can be created. Mostly used for shader effects like shadow-mapping.
   
 * Direct3D9 fonts bugfix
   Finally different fonts can be loaded correctly with Direct3D9.
   
 * Entity and Sprite class name changed
   To clean up more the code base the Entity and Sprite class has changed in declaration.
   "Entity" has been changed in "Mesh" and "Sprite" has been changed in "Billboard".
   Also functions like "createPivot" (now "createMesh") has changed. For a detailed overview take a look at the
   forum (http://www.hlc-games.de/forum).
   
 * Coordinate system balance for OpenGL finished
   Finally the difference between the coordinate Y-axis in OpenGL (which is fliped in comparision to DirectX)
   has been balanced. Now the engine can convert the Y-axis internally but for the user it seams
   to be like in Direct3D9. This feature is used for RenderTargets which replaced more and more
   the feature of making screenshots. Render-to-texture looks now equal with OpenGL and Direct3D9.
   
 * Completely new tutorials has been added to the SDK
   The new tutorials are more comprehensive and better documented.
   
 * VisualC++ support
   Finally the SoftPixel Engine is supported for VisualC++ and its VisualStudio (version 9.0, 2008).
   Now there are project files for Code::Blocks (SoftPixelEngine.cbp) and for VisualStudio (SoftPixelEngine.vcproj).


VERSION 1.9 (version of toolsets: ModelCombiner, LightmapGenerator, ParticleAnimator) [ 28/03/2010 ]

 * ModelCombiner tool created
   A 'GameEngine like' tool to combine two models has been added.
   
 * LightmapGenerator tool created
   A 'GameEngine like' tool to generate lightmaps for the whole scene has been added.
   
 * ParticleAnimator tool created
   A 'GameEngine like' tool to animate a lot of particles/ sprites.
   
 * Entity class was more cleaned up
   Surface management has been redesigned.
   Each vertex/ texture/ surface modification functions are now crash safe.
   
 * Level of detail meshes added
   LOD (Level of detail) feature has been added in the Entity class. Use the "addLODMesh" function.
   
 * Surface optimization optimized
   Sounds funny but it's true, the process of surface optimization has been speeded up.
   
 * Volumetric sounds correction
   3D sound effect has been repaired and works very good now. Listener position
   and orientation is setable by the sound device
   
 * Goodbye for the GUI
   The in-house GUI (GraphicsUserInterface) has been removed from the project completely
   because of incompleteness and uselessness.
   The source code of this part is furthermore available in the "media" folder as a
   detached project.
   
 * Spline translations for node animations
   The node animations now support spline translations for smooth movements.
   
 * Better light manangement
   You can only see 8 light sources with OpenGL and Direct3D9 but the SoftPixel Engine
   sorts the lights in dependent of the distance to camera.
   
 * Mesh buffers in Direct3D9 driver completed
   Finally the vertex- and index buffer creation in the Direct3D9 driver works fine.
   Now the rendering is much faster! Like the VertexBufferObjects (VBOs) with OpenGL.
   
 * Mesh reference function added
   The Entity's "setMeshReference" function can be used to reduce costs of memory.
   This function allows you to link the entity to an other entity's mesh buffer list
   when drawing multiple equal 3d models.
   
 * Frustum culling
   Now each object can get a bounding box to be blended out when it is out of active camera's view frustum.
   
 * New standard primitive "Icosphere" (ENTITY_ICOSPHERE) and rebuild "Dodecahedron"
   Segments/subdevision is the same like in Blender and is in the range of 1 and 8.
   
 * ModelCreator supports Bezier patches now
   The standard primitive "Teapot" is now also created by Bezier patches.
   
 * RenderTargets created
   Using RenderTargets in Direct3D9 and FrameBufferObjects (FBO) in OpenGL.
   Use the function "Texture::makeRenderTarget".
   
 * Complete new SPM format architecture (v.2.0)
   Now the SoftPixelModel format saves much more memory and has a better structure.
   
 * Immediate mesh buffer update
   Now the engine is able to update the mesh buffers immediate, i.e. when changed a vertex coordinate
   the mesh buffer is updated for this single vertex. Can be enabled with "Entity::setUpdateImmediate"
   
 * OpenGL Index buffer support
   Finally the mesh buffers with OpenGL also have an index buffer.
   The time before the engine only used OpenGL vertex buffers.
   Further more there is now more control for the hardware mesh buffers. The following functions are now
   available in the Entity class:
   updateMeshBuffer, updateVertexBuffer, updateIndexBuffer, updateMeshBufferVertex, updateMeshBufferTriangle
   
 * ToxyVision Model (TMF) loading support discontinued.
   There is no longer a support for the unimportant TMF 3d file format.


VERSION 1.8 beta (version of operating-system independence: MS.Windows, GNU/Linux) [ 19/10/2009 ]

 * GNU/Linux support
   This is the first version of the SoftPixel Engine which is running on Linux.
   The engine needs running an X server to work.
   Naturally there are some parts incomplete of the Linux support but these are going
   to be made up.
   
 * Complete new sound system (v.3.0)
   Now the sound "SensitiveSoundSystem" is structured like the video drivers
   so you can choose between different sound APIs.
   The following APIs are planed: OpenAL, DirectSound8, XAudio2, WinMM, Dummy.
   Currently only WinMM and Dummy are supported but the others are going to be added.
   
 * Now Direct3D9 works with hardware-buffer-objects
   Using vertex- and index buffers for 3d models makes rendering much faster.
   
 * Milkshape3D model (MS3D) animation support
   Now the engine is able to load and animate Milkshape3D models too. (but still in progress)
   
 * Animation class has been redesigned for skeletal animation
   Now the bone structure is a more extensive class with more detailed controll.
   It is also faster because the transformations are just processed one times.
   This has been achieved by using children instead of parents.
   Also the "Animator" class has been deleted and the functions has been added to the "SceneManager".
   The "anim" namespace does no longer exist.
   
 * Network system recreated (v.2.0)
   Finally the network system works realy good. It has been recreated and works
   now with UDP protocol for more performace. Only one thread is used for receiving
   incomming messages.
   
 * Script loader recreated (v.2.0)
   Complete new syntax with more flexibility.
   You can extend the class by writing your own script loader as a child class.
   
 * Gouraud shading works correct and is with immediate effect
   the default shading type of the entities
   ( Thanks to the "spieleprogrammierer.de" community :-) )
   
 * Better lighting for "Ray" SoftwareRenderer (v.2.1):
   Normal/ volumetric, directional/ point/ spot lights are available (max. 4 lights)
   
 * Redesigned the file system
   Now read-/ write operations are done with the "File" class (e.g. "MyFile->readString()").
   
 * New standard primitive "Torus knot" (ENTITY_TORUSKNOT)
   Completly configurable with the count of slices, stacks, radius ...
   (Thanks to "Paul's Projects": www.paulsprojects.net)
   
 * New tree-node types has been added:
   Quad-trees and BSP-trees and also Oct-trees has been redesigned.
   
 * Terrain class has been redesigned:
   Finally the terrain class is using quad-trees and GeoMIPMapping.
   The heightmap can be created with high-quality images using floating point data container.
   
 * Collision detection has been redesigned:
   The collision detection system has a new design and other functions.
   The "MiniMatrix" tutorial gives an introduction to the sub-system.
   
 * Finally correct object transformation system
   New functions are "set/ getPositionMatrix" and the same with "Rotation" and "Scale".
   Now 'global' location works perfect.


VERSION 1.7 (version of more graphics: HLSL, D3D real-time shadow, CubeMaps, Ray 2.0) [ 28/06/2009 ]

 * Direct3D9 video driver was developed further:
   - DirectX "High Level Shading Language" (HLSL) support.
   - Lights can be located in 3d space, volumetric lights too
   - 2D text drawing has been added
   
 * Completely revised the "Ray" SoftwareRenderer (v.2.0):
   - External library functions (such as in OpenGL, "rayEnable", "rayTexImage2D" etc.)
     which are written in absolute ANSI C for more performance (also the same thing as in OpenGL)
   - Added texture-mapping, sphere-mapping and eye-linear
   - Perspective-Texture-Mapping & Perspective-Depth-Buffering
   - The problem, when triangles are hidden because one or more vertices
     are to far outside the viewport, has been fixed
   - MIP-mapping cares for better graphics and more performace
   - Correct vertex projection for perspective and orthogonal matrices
   
 * Updated the OpenGL and Direct3D9 shader and real-time shadow
   - Now old assembler shader can be loaded (vertex- and pixel programs)
   - Now the real-time stencil shadow looks correct
   
 * Updated the skelatal-animation for smoothly over-change-sequences.
   
 * Updated the node-animation
   Now the node-animations runs with quaternions too, for smooth and free rotatable movements.
   
 * Finally alpha- and depth functions are integrated
   Now the very big problem of alpha-testing is solved.
   
 * Code base was more cleaned up:
   - Finally the creation of the mipmaps with OpenGL works correct.
   - All dimension classes (vector3d, point2d, matrix4 etc.) have henceforth only 'inline' functions.
   - Many bugs has been found, e.g. in 3ds loading (no longer noticed at the website)
   
 * Wavefront Object (OBJ) saving support.
   
 * Extendet the "Bezier curve" and the "splines" for using in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions
   Use "getBezierValue<dim::point2df>" or "getBezierValue<dim::vector3df>" and "Spline2D" or "Spline3D".
   
 * New texture filter: anisotropic
   The count of samples can be set (normally 2, 4, 8 or 16 such as with anti-aliasing).
   
 * Standard textures can changed into a 1, 2 and new: 3 dimensional texture
   Use the "make1Dimension", "make2Dimensional" or "make3Dimension" function.
   
 * Cubic Environment Maps
   Use the "makeCubeMap" function to generate a cube map texture
   and update it with "VideoDriver::updateCubeMap" for cubic environmental reflections
   
 * Redesigned the matrix transformation techniques
   The engine makes now use of the projection, world, view, texture and color matrices
   
 * Directional lights has been added (now directional-, point-, and spot lights are available)
   
 * More controll of model texturing and blending modes
   - Texture environment settings (modulate, add, addsigned etc.)
   - Bugs in adding textures to models has been fixed
   - More texture-coordinates-generation modes: object- and eye linear, sphere-, normal- and reflection mapping
   - Full blending controll by setting the blend-source and blend-target


VERSION 1.6 (version of the many 3d-file-formats: BSP3, BSP1, OBJ, TMF) [ 08/02/2009 ]

 * Extendet the Direct3D9- and "Ray" SoftwareRenderer (v.1.1):
   - D3D9: is now able to render complex 3d scenes (effects such as sphere-mapping too)
   - D3D9: multi texturing
   - Ray: is now able to render textured line & point wireframe objects
   - Ray: has been more optimized for ploting pixels (important internal function) and drawing 2d images
   
 * Wavefront Object (OBJ) loading support.
   
 * Collision detection & intersection tests with animation
   Now the collision detection and intersection tests
   are always up to date while a model is animating.
   
 * New intersection tests:
   - Pickmode Sphere
   - Pickmode Box
   
 * Parent system bugfixes:
   Now the parent system is finally complete and works correct.
   Also changes by using the matrix inverse function for the parent system
   and skeletal-animation for the inverse transformation matrix.
   
 * Quake 3 Map (BSP) loading support
   Now you can load "Quake III Arena" maps with the "loadScene" function.
   
 * Quake 1 Map (BSP) loading support (in progress, unfinished)
   Now you can load "Quake" maps with the "loadScene" function.
   
 * Where is All the Data (WAD) loading support
   The WAD2 and WAD3 texture file format is supported (Half-Life 1 textures)
   Not usable with the "loadTexture" function! Use the new class "TextureLoaderWAD"
   to load the texture list (WAD files consist of more than one texture).
   
 * Some parts has been cleaned more up:
   - FileSystem
   - Animation
   
 * ToxyVision Model (TMF) loading support.


VERSION 1.5 beta (version of video-driver independence: OpenGL, Direct3D9, Ray SoftwareRenderer) [ 08/11/2008 ]

 * VideoDriver independence:
   Now the "SoftPixel Engine" is able to support other video drivers than "OpenGL"
   Following classes are no longer supported in the SoftPixel Engine because the code
   was moved into the VideoDriver class:
   - DrawingManager
   - TextureLoader
   - FontManager
   
 * "Ray" SoftwareRenderer 1.0:
   The SoftpixelEngine has an own software renderer with the following features:
   - depth test
   - alpha test
   - blend test
   - scissor test
   - 2d drawing (images, rectangles, lines, points, bézier curves)
   - 3d rendering (triangles)
   
 * "Direct3D9" renderer:
   - 2d drawing (images, rectangle, lines, points, bézier curves)
   
 * Change in the coordinate-system:
   Now the "SoftPixel Engine" is using realy the left-hand coordinate system and
   no longer the right-hand coordinate system.
   This effects that all rotation values are now negative. That is to say: if you turned an object
   on the x-axis with a positive value, you must now turn it with a negative value to have the
   same resulting visualization.
   
 * Bugfixes:
   - oct-trees were incomplete: matrix was wrong transformed for collision detection and intersection tests
   
 * Two external libraries are integrated into the "SoftPixel Engine": "jpeglib" & "libpng".
   The "jpeg.dll", "jpeg62.dll" and "libpng.dll" are no longer included in the download-package.
   
 * Splines:
   The new class "math::Spline" and the "video::VideoDriver::draw2DSpline" function have been added.
   
 * Animation textures:
   Now you can create animated textures for short textured sequences.


VERSION 1.4 (undisclosed)

 * Many bugfixes:
   - parent system
   - correct texture mipmapping using origianl "glu" source code as plugin
   - texture class was cleaned up
   - font size & origin position
   
 * New standard model: teapot (original "Utha Teapot").
   
 * Anti Aliasing (2x, 4x, 8x, 16x ...).
   
 * Projection (from 3D to 2D).
   
 * Color material was debuged. Now the engine is able to render the objects with
   the defined color for each vertex with lighting.
   
 * 2D Picking (from 2D to 3D).
   
 * Some function names has been changed (e.g. setVisibility -> setVisible).
   
 * TextureLoader has been devided into additional classes: "TextureLoaderRAW -> TextureLoaderBMP; TextureLoaderJPG ...".
   
 * Direct3D model (*.x) loading support.
   
 * Volumetric lights.
   
 * Extensions in the SPM file format for node, keyframe & skeletal animation.
   
 * Skeletal Animation supported
   Now the "SoftPixel Engine" is able to render skeletal-animation sequences.
   
 * Model loading for the B3D file format is absolutly complete
   Reading the skeleton is also supported.


VERSION 1.3 [ 02/09/2008 ]

 * "OpenGL Shading Language" (GLSL) support
   Now the "SoftPixel Engine" is able to render very complex visual effects
   (Shader are also available for 2d graphics).
   
 * The CollisionDetector supports now "sphere-to-box" collisions.
   
 * And in the CollisionDetector the following has changed:
   "createCollision(..., s32 CollisionType, ...)" to "createCollision(..., std::vector<s32> CollisionTypeList, ...)".
   
 * The "ScriptLoader" has been repaired
   There are no longer public members, now you need to use the 'getTextureList' functions and
   for the sound- and entity list, too.


VERSION 1.2 [ 21/08/2008 ]

 * The "Collision Detection" subsystem is nearly complete. Now it can be used to create
   EgoShooter or other video games because also the "PickMode" in the collision detection
   has been finished.
   
 * Now the bitmap image files are loaded by an own function and no longer by the
   auxBIDImageLoad function of the "glaux.dll" library.
   
 * And two external libraries are no long needed as well: glu32.dll, glut32.dll, glaux.dll
   These libraries will no longer be used in the engine since this version and are no longer
   downloadable at the homepage.
   
 * The SensitiveSoundSystem is also cleaned up. (v.1.1)


VERSION 1.1.1 (undisclosed)

 * The "sp::scene::CollisionDetector" was more cleared but it is still not complete because it is
   not robust! But it is optimized for the first time =).
   
 * Also two classes have been added to the collision-sub-system.


VERSION 1.1 [ 21/07/2008 ]

 * Some further bug fixes.
   Entity texturing was wrong; change over in the keyframe animation was not very nice because
   the last frame was allways lost; matrix rotation "sp::dim::matrix4::rotateMatrix" was wrong
   because the vector was not normalized and now this function wants a "dim::vector3df" and no
   longer three boolean parameters; and two more functions in the "sp::scene::Entity" have benn repaired.


VERSION 1.0.0.1

 * The first very bad bug has been found and removed: in the class "sp::video::Texture"
   the function "setTransFilter" made bad errors because there was a pointer problem.
   The pointer of the image data was to early deleted. Now these function work perfectly.


VERSION 1.0 beta [ 16/05/2008 ]

 * The first beta release version of the "SoftPixel Engine". Currently no bug has been found,
   it's the first 'test' version.
