When you want to develop the SoftPixel Engine further, observe the following conditions and information:

 * Projects files for Windows, Linux and Android are in the root directory of the SDK:
   'SoftPixelEngine(CB).cbp'   -> Code::Blocks Project       (MinGW for Windows and Linux)
   'SoftPixelEngine(VS9).sln'  -> VisualStudio 2008 Solution (VisualC++ for Windows)
   'SoftPixelEngine(VS10).sln' -> VisualStudio 2010 Solution (VisualC++ for Windows and MinGW for Android)
   
 * Project files for iOS are in the "sources/Platform/iOS/" directory.
   
 * Project files for Mac OS X are in the "sources/Platform/MacOSX/" directory.
   
 * All functions begin with a small letter (e.g. 'setPosition' or 'renderScene')
   that shall be uniform
   
 * All blocks look like these:
   
   void function()
   {
       /* code ... */
   }
   
   struct structure
   {
       /* members ... */
   }
   
   {
       /* simple block */
   }
   
   Do not write:
   
   void function() {
       /* code ... */
   }
   
   struct structure() { /* members ... */ }
   
 * Do not use long and incomprehensible names for functions, variables and constants which
   shall be used by the user. Internal and private functions, variables and constants allowed to
   be more differently.
   Classes are also supposed to have normal names and not such as in other libraries,
   e.g. 'ITexture', or 'CAnimated3DSMesh', please use names like 'Texture' or 'SceneGraph'
   
 * Private class members end with an undersqore ( '_' ) and do not begin with "m_" (e.g. "Object_", "Position_" etc.).
   
 * Don't use tabulators in your source files. Use 4 blanks instead.
